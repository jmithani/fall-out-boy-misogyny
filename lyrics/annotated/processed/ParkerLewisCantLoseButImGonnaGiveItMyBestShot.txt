while i passed by your direction
i should have known from your walk, yeah
it was the end of you

it's not like i don't respect your opinion
your quick wit lips, just rip me apart
sometimes, it's times like this, yeah

i got a big mouth
and maybe you could handle shutting it up
a simple contradiction
could shake my whole foundation
parker lewis can't lose

taking back every step towards you
still failing at everything i do
in the meantime just talking with my shoes
converse with my converse
at least they hear a word i say
and scrutinize it
just as far as they can tell what i'm getting at
tied my tongue around my neck

while i passed by your direction
i should have known from your walk, yeah
it was the end of you

it's not like i don't respect your opinion
your quick wit lips, just rip me apart
sometimes, it's times like this, yeah

i got a big mouth
and maybe you could handle shutting it up
a simple contradiction
could shake my whole foundation
parker lewis can't lose

taking back every step towards you
still failing at everything i do
in the meantime just talking with my shoes
converse with my converse
at least they hear a word i say
and scrutinize it
just as far as they can tell what i'm getting at
tied my tongue around my neck
for the last time



this is the last song about you
this is the last song that i waste on youyou laughed off my affections
while i passed by your direction
i should have known from your walk, yeah
it was the end of you

it's not like i don't respect your opinion
your quick wit lips, just rip me apart
sometimes, it's times like this, yeah
