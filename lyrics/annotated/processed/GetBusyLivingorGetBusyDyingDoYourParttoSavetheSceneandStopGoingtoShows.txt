this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but we never stood a chance
and i'm not sure if it matters
if you are the shores
i am the waves begging for big moons
i'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but it must be said again
that all us boys are just screaming
into microphones for attention
because we're just so bored
we never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
i'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

i used to obsess over living
now i only obsess over you
tell me you'd like boys like me better
in the dark lying on top of you

from day one, i talked about getting out
but not forgetting about
how my worst fears are letting out
he said why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
when breathing just passes the time
until we all just get old and die
now talking's just a waste of breath
and living's just a waste of death
and why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
and this is you and me
and me and you

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but it must be said again
that all us boys are just screaming
into microphones for attention
because we're just so bored
we never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
i'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

i used to obsess over living
now i only obsess over you
tell me you'd like boys like me better
in the dark lying on top of you
this has been said so many times

from day one, i talked about getting out
but not forgetting about
how my worst fears are letting out
he said why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
when breathing just passes the time
until we all just get old and die
now talking's just a waste of breath
and living's just a waste of death
and why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
and this is you and me
and me and you
until we've got nothing leftthis has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters

and i'm not sure if it matters
if you are the shores
i am the waves begging for big moons
i'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no

into microphones for attention
because we're just so bored
we never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
i'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

i used to obsess over living
now i only obsess over you
tell me you'd like boys like me better
in the dark lying on top of you
this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
this has been said so many times

from day one, i talked about getting out
but not forgetting about
how my worst fears are letting out
he said why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
when breathing just passes the time
until we all just get old and die
now talking's just a waste of breath
and living's just a waste of death
and why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
and this is you and me
and me and you
until we've got nothing leftthis has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but we never stood a chance
and i'm not sure if it matters
if you are the shores
i am the waves begging for big moons
i'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters

i used to obsess over living
now i only obsess over you
tell me you'd like boys like me better
in the dark lying on top of you
this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
this has been said so many times

from day one, i talked about getting out
but not forgetting about
how my worst fears are letting out
he said why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
when breathing just passes the time
until we all just get old and die
now talking's just a waste of breath
and living's just a waste of death
and why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
and this is you and me
and me and you
until we've got nothing leftthis has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but we never stood a chance
and i'm not sure if it matters
if you are the shores
i am the waves begging for big moons
i'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no
your secret's out

this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but it must be said again
that all us boys are just screaming
into microphones for attention
because we're just so bored
we never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
i'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
your secret's out

this has been said so many times

this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't, don't, don't matter

from day one, i talked about getting out
but not forgetting about
how my worst fears are letting out
he said why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
when breathing just passes the time
until we all just get old and die
now talking's just a waste of breath
and living's just a waste of death
and why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
and this is you and me
and me and you
until we've got nothing leftthis has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but we never stood a chance
and i'm not sure if it matters
if you are the shores
i am the waves begging for big moons
i'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but it must be said again
that all us boys are just screaming
into microphones for attention
because we're just so bored
we never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
i'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

i used to obsess over living
now i only obsess over you
tell me you'd like boys like me better
in the dark lying on top of you

your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't, don't, don't matter

from day one, i talked about getting out
but not forgetting about
how my worst fears are letting out
he said why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
when breathing just passes the time
until we all just get old and die
now talking's just a waste of breath
and living's just a waste of death
and why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
and this is you and me
and me and you
until we've got nothing leftthis has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but we never stood a chance
and i'm not sure if it matters
if you are the shores
i am the waves begging for big moons
i'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
but it must be said again
that all us boys are just screaming
into microphones for attention
because we're just so bored
we never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
i'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
your secret's out

i know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
your secret's out and the best part
is it isn't even a good one
and it's mind over you don't, don't matter

i used to obsess over living
now i only obsess over you
tell me you'd like boys like me better
in the dark lying on top of you
this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
this has been said so many times
that i'm not sure if it matters
