do you have the time
to listen to me whine
about nothing and everything all at once?
i am one of those melodramatic fools
neurotic to the bone no doubt about it

sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think i'm cracking up
am i just paranoid
i'm just stoned

i went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
she said it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
i went to a whore
he said my life's a bore
so quit whining because it's bringing her down

gasping to control
so i better hold ondo you have the time
