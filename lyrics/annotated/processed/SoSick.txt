gotta change my answering machine
now that i'm alone
'cause right now it says that we
can't come to the phone
and i know it makes no sense
'cause you walked out the door
but it's the only way i hear your voice anymore
it's ridiculous
it's been months
and for some reason i just
can't get over us
and i'm stronger then this
ain't no faith in her
always walkin' 'round
with my head down
i'm so over being blue
cryin over you
and i'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said i'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why can't i turn off the radio?
gotta fix that calender i have
that's marked july 15th
because since there's no more you
there's no more anniversary
i'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
and your memory
and how every song reminds me
of what used to be
that's the reason i'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said i'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why can't i turn off the radio?
leave me alone
stupid love songs
don't make me think about her smile
or having my first child
let it go
i'm turning off the radio
'cause i'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing she was still here
