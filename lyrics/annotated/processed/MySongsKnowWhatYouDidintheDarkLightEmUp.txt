can't be sure when they've hit their mark
and besides in the mean-meantime i'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
i'm in the de-details with the devil
so now the world can never get me on my level
i just got to get you out of the cage
i'm a young lovers rage
gonna need a spark to ignite

the writers keep writing what they write
somewhere another pretty vein just dies
i've got the scars from tomorrow and i wish you could see
that you're the antidote to everything except for me
a constellation of tears on your lashes
burn everything you love
then burn the ashes
in the end everything collides
my childhood spat back out the monster that you see
