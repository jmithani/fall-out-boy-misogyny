i'm a leading man
and the lines i weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate

all the boys who the dancefloor didn't love
and all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
sing until your lungs give out

this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (now you)
this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (wear out the groove)
this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (sing out loud)
this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (oh, oh)
this ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

i'm a leading man
and the lies i weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
i'm a leading man
and the lines i weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
