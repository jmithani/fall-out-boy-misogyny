caffeine cold, caffeine cold and i can't see shit

don't breathe life into a monster, then
complain when he destroys it all, again
don't breathe life into a monster, then
complain when he destroys it all, again

now, i smell like cigarettes 'cause i love to breathe your smoke
i smell like alcohol 'cause i drink to believe in more
i have three drinks before i even start to count
i think i'm gonna move way down south

don't breathe life into a monster, then
complain when he destroys it all, again
don't breathe life into a monster, then
complain when he destroys it all, again

i'm not a monster
