yesterday you were on my back just to get my time
i guess it's not as precious as it seems
because i found the time for hanging out and talking on the phone
what should i expect, now that my time is free
and you're nowhere to be found

next time i'll try
for the first time in my life
it won't pass me by
procrastinate it can wait, i put it off
let's start today
let's start today

my room's a mess and i can't get dressed
i gotta be out by eight o'clock
deep inside i know the answer (i know the answer)
well there's no time like the present
and i'd like to hang out but who doesn't
i've made enough mistakes for this lifetime
now i'm here to make amends

next time i'll try
for the first time in my life
it won't pass me by
procrastinate it can wait, i put it off
let's start today
let's start today
(start!)
