I comb the crowd and pick you out
My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed
To "I swear, I say"
To "I swear, I say"

To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
To drinks at the club, to the bar
To the keys to your car, to hotel stairs
To the emergency exit door

To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
"What did it ever do for me," I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me, but I took it, anyway
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy
But never both, love never wanted me

"I hoped you choked and crashed your car"
Hey "tear catcher," that's all that you are
And ever were from the start
I swear, I say
I swear, I say

To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
To drinks at the club, to the bar
To the keys to your car, to hotel stairs
To the emergency exit door

To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
"What did it ever do for me," I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me, but I took it, anyway
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy
But never both, no

To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole as I watched you dress
Kiss and tell, loose lips sink ships
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole as I watched you dress
Kiss and tell, loose lips sink ships
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole as I watched you dress
Kiss and tell, loose lips sink ships

To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
"What did it ever do for me," I say
