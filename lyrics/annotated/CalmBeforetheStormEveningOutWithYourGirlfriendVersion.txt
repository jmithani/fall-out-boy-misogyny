I sat outside my front window
This story's going somewhere
"He's well hung", and I am hanging up
There's a song on the radio that says
"Let's get this party started"
Let's get this party started!

What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world imploded, faded and demoted
All my oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance

You said, between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone, dead and gone
Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight

The next time the phone can wring my neck
It gets no answer
And the time that I've spent telling in my roots
I'm shaking in my boots
But still it looks at me
Like an old friend I've betrayed
The dark side of the doormat
Is the one your shoes have frayed

What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world imploded, faded and demoted
All my oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance

You said, between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone, dead and gone
Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight

Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
Reception less than warm
And the sun burnt out, tonight

Tonight
The sun burnt out
The sun burnt out, tonight
The sun burnt out, tonight
