I got that midnight tennis elbow
Got the solitaire rugburn
Took a turn
An ace up my sleeve (so to speak)

I want to choke
And get sick off of you
Like secondhand smoke
You got me sweating like Calcutta nights
Just heat and epiphany

I am a wing (wing)
I'm a prayer (prayer)
A thimble and an acorn
A promise from a poor apothecary
To an understudy in love forlorn
I'll give you heatstroke
I'm getting you and I'm losing me

We'd get legendary
Tonight little darlin'
Uh huh, little darlin'
But I've got a nomadic head
I love you but I've caught the doom and the dread
We'd get legendary
Tonight little darlin'
Uh huh, little darlin'
But I've got a nomadic head
I love you but I've caught the doom and the dread
