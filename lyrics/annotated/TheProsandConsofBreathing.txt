Bury me standing under your window with this cinder block in hand
Yeah 'cause no one will ever feel like this again
And if I could move, I'm sure it would only be to crawl back to you
I must have dragged my guts a block
They were gone by the time we (talked)

Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing

I hate the way you say my name like it's something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun
Remind me which side you should be on

Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing

I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
(1, 2, 3, 4)

Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
