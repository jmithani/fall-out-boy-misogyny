Count me in unannounced
Drag our friends on the tile
I just follow your trail
You can't just follow my smile
All of your sins are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone
Nothing left to leave behind
You outta reset now
Just like it never happened
I didn't come for a fight
But I will fight till the end
And this one might be your battle, might not turn out okay
I know you think you can kill me, but you've already lost the GA- : )
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A
-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A
-A-A-A-A-AME

And I LOVE the way you "hurt" me
It's DETERMINATION, oh oh oh oh oh yeah
OH OH OH OH OH
OH OH OH OH OH YEAH
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way you keep on trying
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way you keep on dying

I'm gonna break you to peices, just like you were your brother
Gonna kill you again, just like you killed your own mother
You're a fool with no past, say goodbye to your future
Pay the fee, do it kid
I'm talking no inflation
Too many stabs wounds and not enough items
Too much time in the hall
I feel my sins start to crawl
Too many freaks not enough blood in the game
You know I'd give your LOVE a four letter name
Eh eh eh, eh eh eh
Eh eh eh, eh eh eh
Eh eh eh, eh eh eh
Eh eh eh, eh eh eh

And I LOVE the way you "hurt" me
It's DETERMINATION, oh oh oh oh oh yeah
OH OH OH OH OH
OH OH OH OH OH YEAH
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way you keep on trying
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way
I LOVE the way you keep on dying

You killed me again
Again and again
But I come back knowing so much more
Learning all your tricks
I'll make you sick
'Cause the truth is Sans
I'll make you  Q U I T   : )
Try to stay Frisk
Please just stay Frisk
You're still good, good
Admit to this
Don't fight anymore
It's such a snore
One more step
A N D   I ' L L    M A K E    I T   W A R

I still LOVE the the way I "hurt" you (heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh)
It's DETERMINATION, oh oh oh oh oh yeah
OH OH OH OH OH
OH OH OH OH OH YEAH~
I LOVE THE WAY
I LOVE THE WAY
I LOVE THE WAY YOU KEEP ON TRYING
I LOVE THE WAY
I LOVE THE WAY
I LOVE THE WAY YOU KEEP ON DYING
