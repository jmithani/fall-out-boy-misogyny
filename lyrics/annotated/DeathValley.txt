I want to see your animal side
Let it all out
I wanna see the dirt
Under your skin
I need your broken promises

I want the guts and glory baby
This town is wasted and alone

But we are alive
Here in death valley
But don’t take love off the table yet
Cause tonight it’s just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
But we are alive

I want to see your animal side
Let it all out
Oh there you go; undress to impress
You can wear the crown but you’re no princess

So put the “D” in dirt now baby, baby
Let’s get you wasted and alone

Cause we are alive
Here in death valley
But don’t take love off the table yet
Cause tonight it’s just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
But we are alive

We’re going to die
It’s just a matter of time
Hard times come
Good times go
I’m either gone in an instant
Or here 'till the bitter end
I never know
What I’ve got will make you feel more alive
I’ll be your favorite drug, I will get you high
I will get you high

We're still, we are alive
Here in death valley
But don’t take love off the table yet
Cause tonight it’s just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
But we are alive
