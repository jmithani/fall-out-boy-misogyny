Honey is for bees silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep

It doesn't matter how you feel
Life is just a ferris wheel
It's always up and down
Don't make a sound

When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around

It's just the sweet weather and the peacock feathers
In the morning it will all be better
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep

When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around

Honey is for bees silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep
