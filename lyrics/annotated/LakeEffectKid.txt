Sometimes when I'm in heaven
I get forgetful of the earth, woah
Until I hear you bickering like bugs and birds
The heat is off, gate's open, the shade is down

I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called Unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a Lake Effect Kid

Oh, I got the skyline in my veins
Forget your nighttime
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'Til Lakeshore Drive comes back into focus
I just wanna come back to life
Spark my crazy head to keep you warm at night

I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called Unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun, fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a Lake Effect kid
Boomerang my head
To the city I grew up in (back to the city I grew up in)
Again and again and again and again
Forever a Lake Effect Kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a Lake Effect Kid
Boomerang my head
To the city I grew up in (to the city I grew up in)
Again and again and again and again
Forever a Lake Effect Kid

Again and again and again and again and again
