Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your, forever, forever

I need more dreams and less life
I need that dark in a little more light
I cried tears you’ll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean
And leave me be

You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word yes
I'm here to scream

No, no (no, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll (rock and roll)
No, no (no, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your, forever, forever

Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence
For the voice of a generation
Woah
How’d it get to be only me?
Like I’m the last damn kid still kicking
That still believes

I will defend the faith
Going down swinging
I will save the songs
The songs that we can't stop singing

No, no (No, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll (rock and roll)
No, no (No, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll (forever, forever)

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no

You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'yes'
I'm here to scream

No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll (rock and roll)
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
No, no, we won't go (wherever I go, go)
'Cause we don't know when to quit (trouble seems to follow)
Oh no, we won't go (I won't back down, save rock and roll)
'Cause we don't know when to quit, (oh oh)
Oh no, we won't go (wherever I go, go)
'Cause we don't know when to quit (trouble seems to follow)
Oh no, we won't go (I won't back down, save rock and roll)
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
