And this loss of sleep over you

I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus
And here is your...

Flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus
And here is your verse
Here is your...
