My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play like a "Big shot talent"
But at the end of the day you know
Where we come from
And where we call home

Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

They'll say it's not worth it
So we'll leave this town in ruins
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play like a "Big shot talent"
But at the end of the day you know
Those busted lips we take back home

Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
So, hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
So I'll tell everyone how much this means to me

Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
