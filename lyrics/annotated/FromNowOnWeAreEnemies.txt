I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine

A downward spiral, just a pirouette
G-getting worse 'til there's n-n-nothing left
What good comes of something
When I'm just the ghost of nothing, nothing?

I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
(For a)

A lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing 'til, 'til they can't stand it
A composer, but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer, but never composed
Singing, "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"

Heralded as a king before I had a birthday
With double (double) digits (digits)
Fit the crown to my head, but I was only a kid
(Yeah, I was only a kid)
Yeah, I was only a kid, hey

I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees

Oh, a lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing 'til, 'til they can't stand it
A composer, but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer, but never composed
Singing, "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't, I can't have"

I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine

I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees

A lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing 'til, 'til they can't stand it

Singing, "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"

"I only want what I can't, I can't have"
