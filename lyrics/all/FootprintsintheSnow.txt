Fresh footprints in the snow
I never thought, thought that I'd get this cold
I guess you never know
I never thought, thought that I'd get this cold

I know that they say that He died for us
His spirit is something I could use  more
I know that they say that He died for us
But spirit is something I could use  more

And this sadness in our hearts, it's kinda killing me
Oh whoa, it kinda sets me free
Sadness in our hearts, it's kinda killing me
Oh whoa, it kinda sets me free
