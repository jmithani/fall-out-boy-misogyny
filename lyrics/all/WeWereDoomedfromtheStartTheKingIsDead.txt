Hey, darling
Know any bands for my... play my party?
Um, I don't know
How 'bout Fall Out Boy?

The king is dead! (Long live the king)
The king is dead! (Long live the king)
The king is dead! (Long live the king)
The king is dead!

Yeah, I said lord be my savior
Please don't, we've been doomed from the start
Now, we're so dismissive
So the king cannot play the part

Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said yeah

They may never think
And wonder why, dear Christ
Every time I see you
I just want to paint the walls white

Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" (Long live the king)
Yeah, I said yeah
Dead
