Walking out on the show is walking out on you
And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did

Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode

Well, I'm looking out at you
Obscured by the stand up arcade
And the sound of the descendants
Your smile reminds me of switchblades and infidelity

Walking out on the show is walking out on you
And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did

Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode
