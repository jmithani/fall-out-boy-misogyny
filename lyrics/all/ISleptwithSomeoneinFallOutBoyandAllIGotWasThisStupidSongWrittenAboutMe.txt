I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know, you'll never know
And some secrets weren't meant to be told
But I found the cure to growing older

I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now

Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up, no

Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lips
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family 'cause I know you will be missed
So you can find a safe place, brace yourself
They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone
But, for what we've become, we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've got against what I left
So, progress report: I am missing you to death

Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's oh, so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up, no

Someone old, no one new
Feeling borrowed, always blue
Someone old, no one new
Feeling borrowed, always blue
Someone old, no one new
Feeling borrowed, always blue
Someone old, no one new
Always borrowed, always blue
I've found the cure to growing older
I've found the cure to growing older

Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up (Can't cover it up!)
