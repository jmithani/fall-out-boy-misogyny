Drink down that gin and kerosene
Come spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me be
I keep my jealousy close 'cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy
Then I'm not the only one lying

Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday

And I keep my jealousy close 'cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying
Drink down that gin and kerosene
Come spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me

Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday

So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down
I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down
I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
(Keep quiet)
I'll weigh you down
(Nothing comes as easy as you)
I'll watch you choke
(Can I lay in your bed all day?)
You look so good in blue
(You look so good in blue)
You look so good in blue
(You look so good in blue)

Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
(So wear me like a locket around your throat)
