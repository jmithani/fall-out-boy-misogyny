Now I'm the king of the swingers, oh the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop and that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub and stroll right into town
And be just like those other men, I'm tired of monkeyin' around

Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too

Now don't try to kid me, mancub, I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire to make my dream come true
So give me the secret, mancub, hey clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower so I can be like you

Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too, yeah

Now here's your part of the deal, cuz
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire
You, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too

Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk, I wanna walk, I wanna walk and talk like you
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too
