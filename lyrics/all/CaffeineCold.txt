1, 2!

I just want to fill you all with such dread
Let you suck it out, let you suck it out 'til I'm dry and dead
Now, I've got love flowing in my nightmare girl
Caffeine cold, caffeine cold and I can't see shit

Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again
Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again

Now, I smell like cigarettes 'cause I love to breathe your smoke
I smell like alcohol 'cause I drink to believe in more
I have three drinks before I even start to count
I think I'm gonna move way down south

Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again
Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again

I'm not a monster
Just really fucked up
I'm tired
I'll see you in hell
Are you judging me?
Don't laugh at me
Don't laugh at me
No seriously don't laugh at me
It's not funny
I'm not joking
It's not funny
I'm not laughing
