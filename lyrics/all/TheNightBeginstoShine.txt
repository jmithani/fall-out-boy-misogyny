I saw you dance in the corner
I call your name in conversation
Playing hard to get
Well, I can't understand

When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine

Talk 'til dawn, my heart is racing
I took you home in the driving rain
Had my mind made up
I wanna feel your touch

When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine (The night begins to shine)
The night begins to shine (The night begins to shine)
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine (The night begins to shine)
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine


When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine
Night begins to shine (The night begins to shine)
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine (The night begins to shine, shine, shine)
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine
