I am an arms dealer fitting you
With weapons in the form of words
And (don't really care which side wins)
Long as the room keeps singing
That's just the business I'm in

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lines I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate

I wrote the gospel on giving up
(You're looking pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk
(Prima-donnas of the gutter)
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full, please catch another

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lines I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate

All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
Sing until your lungs give out

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Now you)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Wear out the groove)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Sing out loud)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Oh, oh)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lines I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
