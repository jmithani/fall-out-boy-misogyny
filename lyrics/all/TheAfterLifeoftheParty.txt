I'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
And the full moon pills got me out on the street at night

Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room

Oh, put love on hold
Young Hollywood is on the other line
Her nose runs ruby red, Death's in a double bed
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate

Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose

I'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
Kiss away young thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends

Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose (Watch you work the room)

I'm a stitch away...
