PETE: Up next is My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up). This, uh... to me this song was I think, once we got- When I heard Patrick do the verses in this song, I kind of was like 'oh we can build a body of work around this'. I think this was the flagship of what Save Rock and Roll was gonna be. There are songs that are more aggressive, and there are songs that are less aggressive that they all kinda fit around this
PATRICK: I think up to this point in the recording we had been kinda- Butch Walker produced and the band were kinda feeling each other out in terms of kinda figuring out what direction we were gonna go with and all those other things. And I think once this song kinda fell into place the whole record was easy after that.
ANDY: It was like dominoes.
PATRICK: It was like dominoes because I think it gave us like a blueprint.
JOE: It did definitely set up a sonic blueprint for the record for sure
ANDY: Sonic boom
JOE: Boom
