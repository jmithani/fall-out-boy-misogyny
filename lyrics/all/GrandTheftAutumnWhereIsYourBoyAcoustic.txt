When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on
The hope I forget
That you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you

You need him. I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town

Someday I'll appreciate in value, get off my ass and call youin the meantime I'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at 4:00 in the afternoon


(won't find out) he won't find out
(won't find out) he won't find out

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town
