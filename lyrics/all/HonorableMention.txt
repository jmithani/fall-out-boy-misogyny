I served out my detention
And in the end I got an honorable mention
In the movie of my life
Starring you instead of me

When the moonlight
Hits your bright eyes, I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid
Like "I'll never leave your side"

Like the oldest movie I ever saw
Was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you, but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack

I burnt out my defensive
Now, everything I say is taken as offensive
In the movie of my life
Starring you instead of me

When the moonlight
Hits your bright eyes, I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid
Like "I'll never leave your side"

Like the oldest movie I ever saw
Was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you, but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack
Like the oldest movie I ever saw
Was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you, but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack

I can be your John Cusack
