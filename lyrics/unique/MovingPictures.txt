Last night I saw a movie
And I thought about many movies I've seen at your house
Excuse me if I'm rude
But I'd rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without you
Leaning on my shoulder
Distracting me from the plot line

Where can I go when I want you around
But I can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here

"Go to hell" is all I thought for seven weeks
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people
Looking glossed just like the way I still remember a summer ago


"Call me back"
I'm pleading with a bottle cork in my head
It wouldn't be the first time
My pillow has been mistaken


Can't stand to be around you
Around you, around you
Can't stand to be around you
I can't stand, can't stand
To be around you
Around you
