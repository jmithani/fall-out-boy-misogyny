ANDY: So the first song on the record is called 'The Phoenix'
PATRICK: It's a song that- it kinda happened very quickly and then very slowly. We started with this initial burst of inspiration and then it kinda took us a while to figure it out how to finish off the rest of the song. But it was one of the most exciting songs for us I think
PETE: Yeah, it's awesome. I feel like... definitely reminds me of y'know a teenager in the summer when they're around in the fireworks and skateboards
ANDY: The song to me kinda encapsulates the rebirth, I guess. And y'know kinda the idea behind the record. Took for me, y'know that way
PATRICK: There was a time up to getting this song written where I was- I wasn't- it was like "Everything was good" but I didn't feel like my like- like I was in all of it yet. And when I heard this song back the first time, I was like 'it just changed the entire record for me'. So the whole thing, y'know, that's one of the reasons why it's a great first track for us
JOE: I like to think that the music in the chorus is so cool, there's kinda like a couple different counter-melodies going on that I think all like have totally different vibes on there. But when they come together, it can make something incredibly epic
