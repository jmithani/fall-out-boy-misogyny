Here we go again

Welcome to the demolition derby that is my heart
I'm only here to crash a life it was never alright from the start
Sometimes I feel like the whole world is after me
I'm just the best looking pony in the glue factory

But out of every pretty pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all time favorite
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's nothing left
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's nothing left
Nothing left!
Uh!
But out of every pretty pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all time favorite
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's nothing left
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's n-n-nothing left
Nothing left!
Uh!
