That's what I want
Here we go! One...

I am the living that haunts the ghost
The lion paws his own teeth out
So you can love him, now
I am believing

What if it were all a dream?
What if we were demigods?
They'd take to our knees
Raging at the half of our sins

I am the living that haunts the ghost
The lion paws his own teeth out
So you can love him, now
I am the living that haunts the ghost
So go on, pick your poison
Before I pick it for you

What if we grow like a weed?
Feed us trash and moonlight
What if we grow like a weed?
Feed us trash and moonlight, yeah
