I broke the legs of these pedestals that I once built
And now I've left that part behind
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks anymore
That bridge was made for us
I have found the right round  for now
But still I grow

We must loosen our grips on fear of solitude
We shouldn't rely on how people react to what we do
Do what feels right to you and only you
 and push on through

Why can everyone not see what this establishment can do
Make you relieve that fashion will elevate you
So many plastic dolls walking through these halls
They Drown in water one foot deep

We must loosen our grips on fear of solitude
We shouldn't rely on how people react to what we do
Do what feels right to you and only you
