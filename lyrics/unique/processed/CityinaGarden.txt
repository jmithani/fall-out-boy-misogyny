and i'm just living out a suitcase
watch me now, watch me as i drive away
i'm supposed to leave you at the end of the season
but i'll stay (i'll stay)
i'll stay (i'll stay)

you charged me up, charged, charged me up
i was something they forgot to label "fragile"
now i'm stuck
and you know too much, know, know too much
you're the one true thing
you're the one

take me home
take me home
and the streetlights light, light up
to take me home
i love you chicago
you make me feel some summer fling (feel some summer)
you know that i know (i know)
that i owe you everything (everything)
take me home
take me home
and the streetlights light, light up
to take me home
i love you chicago
you make me feel some summer fling (feel some summer)
you know that i know (i know, i know, i know…)
that i owe you everything
i love you chicago
