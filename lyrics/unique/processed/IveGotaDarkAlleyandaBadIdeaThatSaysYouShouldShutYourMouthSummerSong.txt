joke me something awful just like kisses. on the necks of best friends. were the kids who feel like dead ends. and i want to be known for my hits, not just my misses. i took a shot and didnt even come close. at trust and love and hope. and the poets are just kids who didnt make it. and never had it, at all. and the record wont stop skipping. and the lies just wont stop slipping. and besides, my reputations on the line. we can fake it for the airwaves. force our smiles, baby, half dead. from comparing myself. to everyone else around me. please put the doctor on the phone. cause im not making any sense. blame everyone but me for this mess. and my back has been breaking from this heavy heart. we never seemed so far. im hopelessly hopeful. youre just hopeless enough. but we never had it, at all. and the record wont stop skipping. and the lies just wont stop slipping. and besides, my reputations on the line. we can fake it for the airwaves. force our smiles, baby, half dead. from comparing myself. to everyone else around me. to everyone else around me. everyone else around me. everyone else around me
