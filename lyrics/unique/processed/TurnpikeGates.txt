we would drag ourselves to bed. and sleep took everything i had. i kept it up till he would call. you made me feel like a criminal. and then theres you. you kept a smile though i would always walk the wire. you gave it all. i gave you reason to have doubt. i had to get out of there. i took the stairs. i dont wanna fight with you if i cant be the one to have you. you sat that chair like a queen in the kitchen. i memorized the lines your eyes made at every squint you shot my way. we would drag ourselves to bed. and sleep took everything i had. i kept it up till he would call. you made me feel like a criminal. and then theres you. you kept a smile though i would always walk the wire. but youre miserable and im useless. always making up excuses. i made you cry too many times. so im hanging up that line. im throwing rocks at your floor. im knocking down your front door. im desperate tonight and i just wanna fight. its my confusion that lets me act so cold. so now ill go, go, go. and you wanna be just left alone. put down that phone, cause if you want me just call out hey boy
