you say "please don't ever change"
but you don't like me the way
the way that i am
the way that i am

champagne and problems toast
i'll never solve them, oh
i think i woke up on the wrong side of paradise
i'm trying to kick the habit
but when you're not around, i just can't stand it
oh yeah, i think i woke up on the wrong side of paradise

(ooh) the wrong side of paradise
(ooh) the wrong side of paradise
(ooh-ooh) i think i woke up on
(ooh-ooh) the wrong side of paradise
(ooh) the wrong side of paradise
(ooh) the wrong side of paradise
(ooh-ooh) i think i woke up on
the wrong side of paradise
