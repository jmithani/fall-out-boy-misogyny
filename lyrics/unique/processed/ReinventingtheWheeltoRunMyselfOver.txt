i could walk this fine line between elation and success
but we all know which way i'm going to strike the stake between my chest
so, "you have to prove yourself"
you'll have to prove it to me

so now you're waiting up for him
you're wasting time, yeah, every time

whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself

whoa, can't do it by myself
i can't wake up to these reminders of who i am
a failure at everything, 18 going on extinct
i know my place, it's nowhere you should roam

so now you're waiting up for him
still wasting time, yeah, every time
yeah

whoa, i can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself
whoa, can't do it by myself

"you have to prove!"
