you are a getaway car, a rush of blood to the head. but me, im just the covers on top of your bed. you steer away in a rear view mirror, make my head swim. i keep you warm and wont ask you where youve been. with your backless black dress soaked to the skin. when its said and done, theyre all scrambling. and were friends, were friends. just because we move units. strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames. we only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame. at least everyone is trying, everyone is shining. everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame. such a shame. the sounds of this small town make my ears hurt. oh yeah, you caught me but i caught you on worse. they say, you want a war? youve got a war.. but who are you fighting for?. the tides out, the ships run aground. we drown traitors in shallow water. with your backless black dress soaked to the skin. when its said and done, theyre all scrambling. and were friends, were friends. just because we move units. strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames. we only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame. at least everyone is trying, everyone is shining. everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame. such a shame. everyone is trying, everyone is shining. everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame. such a shame. strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames. we only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame. at least everyone is trying, everyone is shining. everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame
