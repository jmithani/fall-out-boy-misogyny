you laughed off my affections. while i passed by your direction. i should have known from your walk, yeah. it was the end of you. its not like i dont respect your opinion. your quick wit lips, just rip me apart. sometimes, its times like this, yeah. i got a big mouth. and maybe you could handle shutting it up. a simple contradiction. could shake my whole foundation. parker lewis cant lose. taking back every step towards you. still failing at everything i do. in the meantime just talking with my shoes. converse with my converse. at least they hear a word i say. and scrutinize it. just as far as they can tell what im getting at. tied my tongue around my neck. for the last time. . this is the last song about you. this is the last song that i waste on you
