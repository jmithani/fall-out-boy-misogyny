up above our heads droning on and on and on
hit it, never quit it, i have been through the wreck
but i can string enough to show my face in the light again

there's a room in a hotel in new york city
that shares our fate and deserves our pity
i don't want to remember it all
the promises are made if you just hold on
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

i just need enough of you to dull the pain
just to get me through the night till we're twins again
'til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
and there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
up above our heads droning on and on and on
keep making trouble 'til you find what you love
i need a new partner in crime and you shrug

hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

a birth and a death on the same day
and, honey, i only appear so i can fade away
i wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
and i can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
