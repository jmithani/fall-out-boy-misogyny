yesterday you were on my back just to get my time. i guess its not as precious as it seems. because i found the time for hanging out and talking on the phone. what should i expect, now that my time is free. and youre nowhere to be found. next time ill try. for the first time in my life. it wont pass me by. procrastinate it can wait, i put it off. lets start today. lets start today. my rooms a mess and i cant get dressed. i gotta be out by eight oclock. deep inside i know the answer (i know the answer). well theres no time like the present. and id like to hang out but who doesnt. ive made enough mistakes for this lifetime. now im here to make amends. next time ill try. for the first time in my life. it wont pass me by. procrastinate it can wait, i put it off. lets start today. lets start today. (start!). next time ill try. for the first time in my life. it wont pass me by. procrastinate it can wait, i put it off. lets start today. lets start today. (start!)
