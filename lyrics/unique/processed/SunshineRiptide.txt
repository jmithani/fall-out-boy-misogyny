i don't even have my own attention
you say "please don't ever change"
but you don't like me the way i am
the sign says "don't tap the glass"
but i read it in reverse, ""ssalg eht pat t'nod syas ngis eht""
the world tried to burn all the mercy out of me
but you know i wouldn't let it
it tried to teach me the hard way
i can't forget it
driving down the coast again
the pills are kicking in
the pills are kicking in
she said "i love you till i don't"
i am just playing house
no idea what i'm doing now
there are no atheists in foxholes
the pressure's getting to me
it's time to throw in the towel

'cause i'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
dancing all alone in the morning light
the sunshine riptide
you came back like a wave when i was feeling alright
the sunshine

call me oluwaburna
i fell in love but i didn't fall down
them say me nah normal
drink hennessy, me nah drink water
make me stumble pon me air jordan
ain't no slowing down, know i keep it rolling now
smoking in my fuckin' brain
passing through my fuckin' mind
feel like i'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
with the sun shining through
got the blunt and the juice, cruise
ridin' through the...

the sunshine riptide
dancing all alone in the morning light
the sunshine riptide
you came back like a wave when i was feeling alright
sun, sun, sun
sun, sun, sun (i'm stuck in the sun)
sun, sun, sun
sun, sun

you are my truest feeling yet
i love you so much
it's just like oxygen
and it's going to my head
a public meltdown
petulant but irreverent
take all your possibilities and take away the limits
take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
i do the best with what i have
the pills are kicking in
the pills are kicking in

'cause i'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
dancing all alone in the morning light
the sunshine riptide
you came back like a wave when i was feeling al-
i'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
dancing all alone in the morning light

you came back like a wave when i was feeling al-
sun, sun, sun
sun, sun, sun (i'm stuck in the-)
sun, sun, sun
sun, sun (i'm stuck in)
