it's getting late have you seen my mates
ma tell me when the boys get here
it's seven o'clock and i want to rock
want to get a belly full of beer
my old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
and my old lady she don't care
my sister looks cute in her braces and boots
a handful of grease in her hair
don't give us none of your aggravation
we had it with your discipline
saturday night's alright for fighting
get a little action in
get about as oiled as a diesel train
gonna set this dance alight
'cause saturday night's the night i like
saturday night's alright, alright, alright
well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
i'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
i may use a little muscle to get what i need
i may sink a little drink and shout out, "she's with me"
a couple of the sound that i really like
are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
i'm a juvenile product of the working class
whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
don't give us none of your aggravation
we had it with your discipline
saturday night's alright for fighting
get a little action in
get about as oiled as a diesel train
gonna set this dance alight
'cause saturday night's the night i like
saturday night's alright, alright, alright
saturday
don't give us none of your aggravation
we had it with your discipline
saturday night's alright for fighting
get a little action in
get about as oiled as a diesel train
gonna set this dance alight
'cause saturday night's the night i like
saturday night's alright, alright, alright
saturday
