that's what i want
here we go! one...

i am the living that haunts the ghost
the lion paws his own teeth out
so you can love him, now
i am believing

what if it were all a dream?
what if we were demigods?
they'd take to our knees
raging at the half of our sins

i am the living that haunts the ghost
the lion paws his own teeth out
so you can love him, now
i am the living that haunts the ghost
so go on, pick your poison
before i pick it for you

what if we grow like a weed?
feed us trash and moonlight
what if we grow like a weed?
feed us trash and moonlight, yeah
