it's- be quiet, be quiet

they've got us surrounded, we're in their sights
but they're not taking us alive
hot to the touch, cold on the inside
but they're not taking us alive
they've got us surrounded, we're in their sights
but they're not taking us alive
hot to the touch, cold on the inside
but they're not taking us alive

if i was still around, walk me through
i am your savior now and i'm your secret, too
carry them alive, fall off the case again
you're just a black widow who fell in love with herself

they've got us surrounded, we're in their sights
but they're not taking us alive
hot to the touch, cold on the inside
but they're not taking us alive

if it's never been broken, can't believe in it
now you're just a problem for someone else to fix
if i was still around, if i'm near you
i am your savior, yeah, i am your secret, too

they've got us surrounded, we're in their sights
but they're not taking us alive
hot to the touch, cold on the inside
but they're not taking us alive

bull shitty crap shit...
