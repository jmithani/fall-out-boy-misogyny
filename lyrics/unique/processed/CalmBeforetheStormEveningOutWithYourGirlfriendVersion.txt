i sat outside my front window. this storys going somewhere. hes well hung, and i am hanging up. theres a song on the radio that says. lets get this party started. lets get this party started!. what you do on your own times just fine. my imaginations much worse, i just never want to know. what meant the world imploded, faded and demoted. all my oxygen to product gas. and suffocated my last chance. you said, between your smiles and regrets. dont say its over. dead and gone, dead and gone. calm before the storm set it off. and the sun burnt out, tonight. a reception less than warm set it off. and the sun burnt out, tonight. the next time the phone can wring my neck. it gets no answer. and the time that ive spent telling in my roots. im shaking in my boots. but still it looks at me. like an old friend ive betrayed. the dark side of the doormat. is the one your shoes have frayed. what you do on your own times just fine. my imaginations much worse, i just never want to know. what meant the world imploded, faded and demoted. all my oxygen to product gas. and suffocated my last chance. you said, between your smiles and regrets. dont say its over. dead and gone, dead and gone. calm before the storm set it off. and the sun burnt out, tonight. a reception less than warm set it off. and the sun burnt out, tonight. calm before the storm set it off. and the sun burnt out, tonight. reception less than warm. and the sun burnt out, tonight. tonight. the sun burnt out. the sun burnt out, tonight. the sun burnt out, tonight
