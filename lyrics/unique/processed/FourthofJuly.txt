you and i were, you and i were fire
you and i were, you and i were fire
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fire

it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
that went off too soon
and i miss you in the june gloom too
it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
i said i'd never miss you
but i guess you never know
may the bridges i have burned
light my way back home on the fourth of july

i'll be as honest as you'll let me
i miss your early morning company
if you get me
you are my favorite what if
you are my best i'll never know
and i'm starting to forget
just what summer ever meant to you
what did it ever mean to you?

oh, i'm sorry i didn't mean any of it
i just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
in between being young and being right
you were my versailles at night

it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
that went off too soon
and i miss you in the june gloom too
it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
i said i'd never miss you
but i guess you never know
may the bridges i have burned
light my way back home on the fourth of july

my 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
again and again till i'm stuck in your head
had my doubts but i let them out
you are the drought
and i'm the holy water you have been without
and all my thoughts of you
they could heat or cool the room
and no, don't tell me you cried
oh, honey, you don't have to lie

oh, i'm sorry i didn't mean any of it
i just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
in between being young and being right
you were my versailles at night

it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
that went off too soon
and i miss you in the june gloom too
it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
i said i'd never miss you
but i guess you never know
may the bridges i have burned
light my way back home on the fourth of july

i wish i'd known how much you loved me
i wish i cared enough to know
i'm sorry every song's about you
the torture of small talk with someone you used to love

it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
that went off too soon
and i miss you in the june gloom too
it was the fourth of july
you and i were, you and i were fire, fire, fireworks
i said i'd never miss you
but i guess you never know
may the bridges i have burned
light my way back home on the fourth of july
