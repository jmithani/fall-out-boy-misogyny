better off against worse for wear
and you're someone who knows someone
who knows someone i once knew
and i just want to be a part of this
the road outside my house is paved with good intentions
hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
and you are the dreamer and we are the dream
i could write it better than you ever felt it

so hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
i thought i loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
a teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
i sing the blues and swallow them too

my words are my faith, to hell with our good name
a remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
and one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
we're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
i love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
one foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
i could write it better than you ever felt it
