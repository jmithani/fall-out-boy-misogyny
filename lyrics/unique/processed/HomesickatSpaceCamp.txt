(tonight im writing you) a million miles away. tonight is all about we miss you. (we miss you) we miss you (we miss you). tonight is all about we miss you. and i cant forget your style or your cynicism. somehow it was like you were the first to listen. to everything we said. my smiles an open wound without you. and my hands are tied to pages inked to bring you back. tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say. (tonight im writing you) a million miles away. tonight is all about we miss you. (we miss you) we miss you (we miss you). tonight is all about we miss you. these friends are, new friends are golden. these friends are, new friends are golden. these friends are, new friends are golden. these friends are, new friends are. tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say. tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say. tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say. these friends are, new friends are golden
