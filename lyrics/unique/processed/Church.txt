if you were church, i'd get on my knees
confess my love, i'd know where to be
my sanctuary, you're holy to me
if you were church, i'd get on my knees
i'd get on my knees, i'd get on my knees

take the pain
make it billboard big and swallow it for me
time capsule for the future
trust me, that's what i will be
oh, the things that you do in the name of what you love
you are doomed but just enough
you are doomed but just enough

if you were church, whoo
i'd get on my knees, yeah
confess my love, i'd know where to be
my sanctuary, you're holy to me
if you were church, yeah, i'd get on my knees
i'd get on my knees, whoo
i'd get on my knees
i'd get on my knees

i love the world but i just don't love the way it makes me feel
got a few more fake friends
and it's getting hard to know what's real
and if death is the last appointment
then we're all just sitting in the waiting room (mr. stump?)
i am just a human trying to avoid my certain doom

if you were church, yeah
i'd get on my knees
confess my love, i'd know where to be
my sanctuary, you're holy to me
if you were church, yeah, i'd get on my knees
i'd get on my knees, yeah, oh
i'd get on my knees, ah ah ah
i'd get on my knees, yeah
i'd get on my knees
if you were church
i'd get on my knees
confess my love, i'd know where to be
my sanctuary, you're holy to me, you're holy to me
if you were church, yeah, i'd get on my knees, yeah
