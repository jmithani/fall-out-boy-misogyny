oh na na na na na na na na

i never really feel a thing
i'm just kinda too frozen
you were the only one
that even kinda came close
i just pinch myself
no longer comatose
i woke up, no luck
i woke up, no luck

and when your stitch comes loose
i wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
and stuffing that comes out of you, you
i took too many hits off this memory
i need to come down

an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight, or don't
oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight, or don't
oh na na na na na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na
oh na na na na na na na na na na na

i got too high again
realized i can't not be with you
or be just your friend
i love you to death
but i just can't, i just can't pretend
we were lovers first
confidants but never friends
were we ever friends?

but when your stitch comes loose
i wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
and stuffing that comes out of you, you
i took too many hits off this memory
i need to come down

an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight, or don't
oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight, or don't
oh na na na na na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na
oh na na na na na na na na na na na
hold me tight, or don't

'cause i'm past the limits
the distance between us
it sharpens me like a knife
past the limits
the distance between us
it sharpens me like a knife

an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight, or don't
i'm pretty sure that this isn't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight
hold me tight, or don't
oh na na na na na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na
oh na na na na na na na na na na na
