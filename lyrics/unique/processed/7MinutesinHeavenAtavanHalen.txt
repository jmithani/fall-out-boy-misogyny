i'm sleeping my way out of this one
with anyone who will lie down
i'll be stuck fixated on one star
when the world is crashing down

i keep telling myself
i keep telling myself
i'm not the desperate type
but you've got me looking in through blinds
i keep telling myself
i keep telling myself
i'm not the desperate type

sitting out dances on the wall
trying to forget everything that isn't you
i'm not going home alone
'cause i don't do too well
sitting out dances on the wall
trying to forget everything that isn't you
i'm not going home alone
'cause i don't do too well on my own

the only thing worse than not knowing
is you thinking that i don't know
i'm having another episode
i just need a stronger dose

i keep telling myself
i keep telling myself
i'm not the desperate type
but you've got me looking in through blinds
i keep telling myself
keep telling myself
i'm not the desperate type

sitting out dances on the wall
trying to forget everything that isn't you
i'm not going home alone
'cause i don't do too well
sitting out dances on the wall
trying to forget everything that isn't you
i'm not going home alone
'cause i don't do too well

ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra
ta-ra-ra-ra
doo, doo, doo

i keep telling myself
i keep telling myself
i'm not the desperate type
but you've got me looking in through blinds
i keep telling myself
keep telling myself
i'm not the desperate type

sitting out dances on the wall
trying to forget everything that isn't you
i'm not going home alone
'cause i don't do too well on my own
