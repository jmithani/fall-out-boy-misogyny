walking off that stage tonight
i know what you're thinking
"he stands alone because he's high on himself"
but if you only knew

i was terrified and would you mind if i
sat next to you and watched you smile
so many kids but i only see you
and i don't think you notice me
well i've seen your boyfriend
and i don't think he treats you right
but that's none of my business is it?

i'm not the way you think i am, no
i'm not the way you think i am, no

the only girl who ever gave me the time
was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine
knocking boots in the back
how degrading is that?
i decline
