i thought of angels
choking on their halos
get them drunk on rose water
see how dirty i can get them
pulling out their fragile teeth
and clip their tiny wings

anything you say can and will be held against you
so only say my name
it will be held against you
anything you say can and will be held against you
so only say my name

if heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
then i’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(i know i’m bad news)
for just one yesterday
(i saved it all for you)
i want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
still i’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(i know i’m bad news)
for just one yesterday
(i saved it all for you)
for just one yesterday

letting people down is my thing baby
find yourself a new gig
this town ain’t big enough for two of us
i don’t have the right name
or the right looks
but i have twice the heart

anything you say can and will be held against you
so only say my name
it will be held against you
anything you say can and will be held against you
so only say my name (name)

if heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
then i’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(i know i’m bad news)
for just one yesterday
(i saved it all for you)
i want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
still i’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(i know i’m bad news)
for just one yesterday
(i saved it all for you)
for just one yesterday

if i spilled my guts
the world would never look at you the same way
and now i’m here to give you all of my love (whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
so i can watch your face as i take it all away (whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

if heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
then i’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(i know i’m bad news)
for just one yesterday
(i saved it all for you)
i want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
still i’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(i know i’m bad news)
for just one yesterday
(i saved it all for you)
for just one yesterday

whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
