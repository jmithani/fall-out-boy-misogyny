i'm a preacher sweating in the pew
for the salvation i'm bringing you
i'm a salesman, i'm selling you hooks and plans
and myself making demands

when i'm home alone, i just dance by myself
and you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
signing off "i'm alright in bed but i'm better with a pen"
the kid was alright but it went to his head

i am god's gift but why would he bless me with
such wit without a conscience equipped
i'm addicted to the way i feel when i think of you, woah
"there's too much green to feel blue"

when i’m home alone, i just can’t stop myself
and you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
signing off "i'm alright in bed but i'm better with a pen"
the kid was alright but it went to his head

when i'm home alone, i just can't stop myself
and you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
signing off "i'm alright in bed but i'm better with a pen
i'm alright in bed but i'm better with a pen
i'm alright in bed but i'm better with a pen
the kid was alright but it went to his head
