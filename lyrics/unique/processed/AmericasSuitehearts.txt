you could have knocked me out with a feather
i know you've heard this all before, but we're just hell's neighbors
why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?
in my dreams trees grow all over the streets
but i don't know much about classic cars (cars)
but i've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
down, set, one, hut, hut, hike
media blitz

let's hear it for america's sweethearts
but i must confess
i'm in love with my own sins
let's hear it for america's sweethearts
but i must confess
i'm in love with my own sins

you can bow and pretend that
you don't, don't know you're a legend
time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet
(..sorry i just..) let my love loose again
i don't know much about classic cars (cars)
but i've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
down, set, one, hut, hut, hike
media blitz

let's hear it for america's sweethearts
but i must confess
i'm in love with my own sins
