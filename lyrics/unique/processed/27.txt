if home is where the heart is, then we're all just fucked
i can't remember, i can't remember
and i want it so bad, i'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
i can't remember the good old days

and it's kind of funny
the way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
when being anchored aboard
just feels like a curse

my mind is a safe, and if i keep it, then we all get rich
my body is an orphanage, we take everyone in
doing lines of dust and sweat off last night's stage
just to feel like you

the m-m-milligrams in my head burning tobacco in the wind
chasing the direction, chasing the direction you went
you're a bottled star, the planets align, you're just like mars
you shine in the sky, you shine in the sky

are all the good times getting gone?
they come and go and go and come and go, oh yeah
i've got a lot of friends who are stars
but some are just black holes

my mind is a safe, and if i keep it, then we all get rich
my body is an orphanage, we take everyone in
doing lines of dust and sweat off last night's stage
just to feel like you

and it's kind of funny
the way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
when being anchored aboard
just feels like a curse

my mind is a safe, and if i keep it, then we all get rich
my body is an orphanage, we take everyone in
doing lines of dust and sweat off last night's stage
just to feel like you

if home is where the heart is
then we're all just fucked
