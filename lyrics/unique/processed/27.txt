if home is where the heart is, then were all just fucked. i cant remember, i cant remember. and i want it so bad, id shoot the sunshine into my veins. i cant remember the good old days. and its kind of funny. the way were wearing anchors on our shirts. when being anchored aboard. just feels like a curse. my mind is a safe, and if i keep it, then we all get rich. my body is an orphanage, we take everyone in. doing lines of dust and sweat off last nights stage. just to feel like you. the m-m-milligrams in my head burning tobacco in the wind. chasing the direction, chasing the direction you went. youre a bottled star, the planets align, youre just like mars. you shine in the sky, you shine in the sky. are all the good times getting gone?. they come and go and go and come and go, oh yeah. ive got a lot of friends who are stars. but some are just black holes. my mind is a safe, and if i keep it, then we all get rich. my body is an orphanage, we take everyone in. doing lines of dust and sweat off last nights stage. just to feel like you. and its kind of funny. the way were wearing anchors on our shirts. when being anchored aboard. just feels like a curse. my mind is a safe, and if i keep it, then we all get rich. my body is an orphanage, we take everyone in. doing lines of dust and sweat off last nights stage. just to feel like you. if home is where the heart is. then were all just fucked
