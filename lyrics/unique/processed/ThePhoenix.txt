put on your war paint

you are a brick tied to me that’s dragging me down
strike a match and i’ll burn you to the ground
we are the jack-o-lanterns in july
setting fire to the sky
here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(put on your war paint)
cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
silver clouds with grey linings

so we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
one maniac at a time we will take it back
you know time crawls on when you’re waiting for the song to start
so dance alone to the beat of your heart

hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
like our time is running out?
i’m going to change you like a remix
then i’ll raise you like a phoenix
wearing our vintage misery
no, i think it looked a little better on me
i’m going to change you like a remix
then i’ll raise you like a phoenix

bring home the boys in scraps, scrap metal the tanks
get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"you broke our spirit," says the note we pass

so we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
one maniac at a time we will take it back
you know time crawls on when you’re waiting for the song to start
so dance alone to the beat of your heart

hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
like our time is running out?
i’m going to change you like a remix
then i’ll raise you like a phoenix
wearing our vintage misery
no, i think it looked a little better on me
i’m going to change you like a remix
then i’ll raise you like a phoenix

put on your war paint

the war is won before it’s begun
release the doves, surrender love
the war is won before it’s begun
release the doves, surrender love
the war is won before it’s begun
release the doves, surrender love
(wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
the war is won before it’s begun
(wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
release the doves, surrender love
(wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)

hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel

i’m going to change you like a remix
