andy: so the first song on the record is called the phoenix. patrick: its a song that- it kinda happened very quickly and then very slowly. we started with this initial burst of inspiration and then it kinda took us a while to figure it out how to finish off the rest of the song. but it was one of the most exciting songs for us i think. pete: yeah, its awesome. i feel like... definitely reminds me of yknow a teenager in the summer when theyre around in the fireworks and skateboards. andy: the song to me kinda encapsulates the rebirth, i guess. and yknow kinda the idea behind the record. took for me, yknow that way. patrick: there was a time up to getting this song written where i was- i wasnt- it was like everything was good but i didnt feel like my like- like i was in all of it yet. and when i heard this song back the first time, i was like it just changed the entire record for me. so the whole thing, yknow, thats one of the reasons why its a great first track for us. joe: i like to think that the music in the chorus is so cool, theres kinda like a couple different counter-melodies going on that i think all like have totally different vibes on there. but when they come together, it can make something incredibly epic
