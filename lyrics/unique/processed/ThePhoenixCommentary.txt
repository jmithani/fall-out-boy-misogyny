andy: so the first song on the record is called 'the phoenix'
patrick: it's a song that- it kinda happened very quickly and then very slowly. we started with this initial burst of inspiration and then it kinda took us a while to figure it out how to finish off the rest of the song. but it was one of the most exciting songs for us i think
pete: yeah, it's awesome. i feel like... definitely reminds me of y'know a teenager in the summer when they're around in the fireworks and skateboards
andy: the song to me kinda encapsulates the rebirth, i guess. and y'know kinda the idea behind the record. took for me, y'know that way
patrick: there was a time up to getting this song written where i was- i wasn't- it was like "everything was good" but i didn't feel like my like- like i was in all of it yet. and when i heard this song back the first time, i was like 'it just changed the entire record for me'. so the whole thing, y'know, that's one of the reasons why it's a great first track for us
joe: i like to think that the music in the chorus is so cool, there's kinda like a couple different counter-melodies going on that i think all like have totally different vibes on there. but when they come together, it can make something incredibly epic
