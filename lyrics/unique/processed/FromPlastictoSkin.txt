i broke the legs of these pedestals that i once built. and now ive left that part behind. it doesnt matter what anyone else thinks anymore. that bridge was made for us. i have found the right round  for now. but still i grow. we must loosen our grips on fear of solitude. we shouldnt rely on how people react to what we do. do what feels right to you and only you.  and push on through. why can everyone not see what this establishment can do. make you relieve that fashion will elevate you. so many plastic dolls walking through these halls. they drown in water one foot deep. we must loosen our grips on fear of solitude. we shouldnt rely on how people react to what we do. do what feels right to you and only you
