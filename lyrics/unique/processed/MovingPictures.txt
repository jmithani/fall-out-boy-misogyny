last night i saw a movie. and i thought about many movies ive seen at your house. excuse me if im rude. but id rather that we just strike from the record ones id see again without you. leaning on my shoulder. distracting me from the plot line. where can i go when i want you around. but i cant stand to be around you. go home. ill walk myself to you. ill walk myself away from here. go to hell is all i thought for seven weeks. but i grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people. looking glossed just like the way i still remember a summer ago. . call me back. im pleading with a bottle cork in my head. it wouldnt be the first time. my pillow has been mistaken. . cant stand to be around you. around you, around you. cant stand to be around you. i cant stand, cant stand. to be around you. around you
