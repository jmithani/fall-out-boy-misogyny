say my name, and his in the same breath. i dare you to say they taste the same. let the leaves fall off in the summer. and let december glow in flames. erase myself and let go. start it over again in mexico. these friends, they dont love you. they just love the hotel suites, now. i dont care what you think. as long as its about me. the best of us can find happiness in misery. i dont care what you think. as long as its about me. the best of us can find happiness in misery. oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance. im not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants. pull a breath like another cigarette. pawn shop heart trading up, said no. im the oracle in my chest. let the guitar scream like a fascist. sweat it out, shut your mouth. free love on the streets, but. in the alley it aint that cheap now. i dont care what you think. as long as its about me. the best of us can find happiness in misery. i dont care what you think. as long as its about me. the best of us can find happiness in misery. said-a, i dont care just a-what you think. as long as its about me, you said-a. i dont care just what you think. as long as its about me, you said-a. i dont care (i dont care). you said i dont care (i dont care). said i dont care, i dont care. i dont care (i dont care), i said-a, i dont care. i dont care what you think. as long as its about me. the best of us can find happiness in misery. i dont care what you think. as long as its about me. the best of us can find happiness in misery
