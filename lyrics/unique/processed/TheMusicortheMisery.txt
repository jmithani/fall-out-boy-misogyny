i got my stitches stitched, i got my fixes fixed
in my aching head, i got my kisses slit
our gossip lips stuttered every word i said, i said
i got your love letters, corrected the grammar and sent them back
it's true, romance is dead, i shot it in the chest then in the head

and if you wanna go down in history then i'm your prince
because they've got me in a bad way
i've never seen a heart i couldn't break
it was never about the songs, it was competition
make the biggest scene, make the biggest...

which came first, the music or the misery?
we're high-fashion, we're last chances
which came first, the music or the misery?
we're high-fashion, we're last chances

i'm casually obsessed and i've forgiven death
i am indifferent, yet (i am a total wreck)
i'm every cliche, but i simply do it best

and if you wanna go down in history then i'm your prince
because they've got me in a bad way
i've never seen a heart i couldn't break
it was never about the songs, it was competition
make the biggest scene, make the biggest...

which came first, the music or the misery?
we're high-fashion, we're last chances
which came first, the music or the misery?
we're high-fashion, we're last chances

(go!)
i went to sleep a poet and i woke up a fraud
to calm your nerves i'm feeling for my clothes in the dark

which came first, the music or the misery?
we're high-fashion, we're last chances

which came first, the music or the misery?
we're high-fashion, we're last chances
which came first, the music or the misery?
we're high-fashion, we're last chances
