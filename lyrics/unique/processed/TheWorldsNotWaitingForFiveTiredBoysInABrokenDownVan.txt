this might just be a waste of time
there's no one i'd rather waste
my time with than all my best friends
so start the car up
we'll all take turns not for the worst
we're all "hasbeens" and "never-were's"
and we're all in the back singing "roxanne"
just watching life pass us by
pass us by
as if we cared
enough to try to catch up
enough to make up for lost time
enough to make up for lost time, yeah

we've been down
we've been out
we've been hanging round
tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
start the van
get me out of this one horse town
waste this night
