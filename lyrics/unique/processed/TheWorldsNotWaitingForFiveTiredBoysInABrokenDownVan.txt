this might just be a waste of time. theres no one id rather waste. my time with than all my best friends. so start the car up. well all take turns not for the worst. were all hasbeens and never-weres. and were all in the back singing roxanne. just watching life pass us by. pass us by. as if we cared. enough to try to catch up. enough to make up for lost time. enough to make up for lost time, yeah. weve been down. weve been out. weve been hanging round. tip our glasses to no direction, yeah. start the van. get me out of this one horse town. waste this night
