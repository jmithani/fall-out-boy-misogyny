i'm calling you from the future
to let you know we've made a mistake
and there's a fog from the past that's giving me, giving me such a headache
and i'm back with a madness
i'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions
i got nothing but dreams inside, i got nothing but dreams

i'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
but young enough not to know what to believe in
young enough not to know what to believe in, yeah

if i can live through this
if i can live through this
if i can live through this
i can do anything
if i can live through this
if i can live through this
if i can live through this
i can do anything

champion, champion
champion, champion

i got rage every day, on the inside
the only thing i do is sit around and kill the time
i'm trying to blow out the pilot light
i'm trying to blow out the light

i'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
but young enough not to know what to believe in
young enough not to know what to believe

if i can live through this
if i can live through this
if i can live through this
i can do anything
if i can live through this
if i can live through this
if i can live through this
i can do anything

champion, champion
and i can do anything
champion, champion
and i can do anything
champion, champion
