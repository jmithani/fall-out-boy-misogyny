and you lock the house to keep your secret from coming out
i won't, no
i'm sorry because you're old news

and my life is holding our heads to this gun
you and your new boy think you can come in and keep me off, but you're wrong

i find myself on the street out in front of your house, you can kiss safe thoughts goodbye
i'm coming up to break your heart
you're sleeping with the light on like you're dying to be found out

and you lock the house to keep your secret from coming out
i won't, no. i'm sorry because you're old news

and my life is holding our heads to this gun
you and your new boy think you can come in and keep me off, but you're wrong

i find myself on the street out in front of your house, you can kiss safe thoughts goodbye
i'm coming up to break your heart
you're sleeping with the light on like you're dying to be found out

(and you lock the house)
and you lock the house
oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
and you lock the house
oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
