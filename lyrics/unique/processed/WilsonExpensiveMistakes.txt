i was, i was, i was, i was
gonna say something that would solve all our problems
but then i got drunk and i forgot what i was talking about
i forgot what i was talking about
don't you, don't you, don't you know
there's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody
there's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody but you
than to be loved by everybody but you, but you

if i can get my shit together
i'm gonna run away and never see any of you again
never see any of you again

i hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
i always make such expensive mistakes
i know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa, whoa)
when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa)
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

woke up on the wrong side of p-p-paradise
and when i say i'm sorry i'm late
i wasn't showing up at all
i really mean i didn't plan on showing up at all
don't you, don't you, don't you know
i hate all my friends, i miss the days when i pretended
i hate all my friends, i miss the days when i pretended with you
i miss the days when i pretended with you, with you

if i can get my shit together
i'm gonna run away and never see any of you again
never see any of you again

i hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
i always make such expensive mistakes
i know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa, whoa)
when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa)
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa, whoa)
when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa)
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

if we hadn't done this thing
i think i'd be a medicine man
so i could get high on our own supply whenever i can
i became such a strange shape
such a strange shape from trying to fit in
i became such a strange shape
such a strange shape

i hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
i always make such expensive mistakes
i know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa, whoa)
when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa)
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa, whoa)
when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa)
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(whoa, whoa)
i'll stop wearing black
i'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
