i served out my detention
and in the end i got an honorable mention
in the movie of my life
starring you instead of me

when the moonlight
hits your bright eyes, i go blind
and maybe next time
i'll remember not to tell you something stupid
like "i'll never leave your side"

like the oldest movie i ever saw
was the one we wrote together
i said i hate you, but i'd never change a thing
i can be your john cusack

i burnt out my defensive
now, everything i say is taken as offensive
in the movie of my life
starring you instead of me

when the moonlight
hits your bright eyes, i go blind
and maybe next time
i'll remember not to tell you something stupid
like "i'll never leave your side"

like the oldest movie i ever saw
was the one we wrote together
i said i hate you, but i'd never change a thing
i can be your john cusack
like the oldest movie i ever saw
was the one we wrote together
i said i hate you, but i'd never change a thing
i can be your john cusack

i can be your john cusack
