i wrote a goodbye note in lipstick on your arm
when you passed out
i couldn't bring myself to call
except to call it quits

best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
better off as lovers and not the other way around
racing through the city, windows down
in the back of yellow checkered cars

yo-ho-ho, whoa
oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
yo-ho-ho, whoa
oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa

this city says
come hell or high water
well, i'm feeling hot and wet
i can't commit to a thing
be it heart or hospital

best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
better off as lovers and not the other way around
racing through the city, windows down
in the back of yellow checkered cars

yo-ho-ho, whoa
oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
yo-ho-ho, whoa
oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa

the tombstones were waiting
they were half-engraved
they knew it was over
just didn't know the date

and i cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
the same way i think of you
this is a love song in my own way
happily ever after below the waist

best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
better off as lovers
racing through the city, windows down
in the back of yellow checkered cars

yo-ho-ho, whoa
oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
yo-ho-ho, whoa
oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa

best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
better off as lovers and not the other way around
ex-friends 'til the end
better off as yo-ho-ho-oh
