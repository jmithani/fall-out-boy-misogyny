do you, do-do you remember
when we drove, we drove, drove through the night
and we danced, we danced to rancid
and we danced, we danced
and i confessed, confessed
to you riding shot-gun
underneath the purple skies
and we danced, we danced
with windows down
and we danced, we danced
(spin for you like your favorite records used to)
(spin for you like your favorite records)

you were the song stuck in my head
every song that i've ever loved
play it again and again and again
and you can get what you want but it's never enough
and i spin for you like your favorite records used to
and i spin for you like your favorite records used to
oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh

and i can’t, i can’t
i can’t remember just how to forget
forget the way that we danced
we danced to danzig
and we danced, we danced
and when you ask, you ask me how i’m doing
like you know, you know how much better off i am
and when we danced, we danced
with windows down
and we danced, we danced
(spin for you like your favorite records used to)
(spin for you like your favorite records)

you were the song stuck in my head
every song that i've ever loved
play it again and again and again
and you can get what you want but it's never enough
and i spin for you like your favorite records used to
and i spin for you like your favorite records used to
oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh

i spin, i spin, i spin, i spin
for you, for you, for you, for you, for yoooooou-oooh-oh
(spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to
spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to)
