i've loved everything about you that hurt
so let me see your moves
let me see your moves
lips pressed close to mine
true blue
but the prince of any failing empire knows that
everybody wants, everybody wants
to drive on through the night
if it's a drive back home

things aren't the same anymore
some nights, they get so bad
you almost pick up the phone

trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
i sleep with your old shirts
and walk through this house in your shoes
you know, it's strange
it's a strange way of saying
that i know i'm supposed to love you
i'm supposed to love you

i've already given up on myself twice
third time is the charm, third time is the charm
threw caution to the wind
but i've got a lousy arm
and i've traced your shadows on the wall
now i kiss them whenever i'm down
whenever i'm down
figured on not figuring myself out

things aren't the same anymore
some nights, they get so bad
i almost pick up the phone

trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
i sleep with your old shirts
and walk through this house in your shoes
you know, it's strange
it's a strange way of saying
that i know i'm supposed to love you
i'm supposed to love you

born under a bad sign, you saved my life
that night on the roof of your hotel
"cross my heart and hope to die
splintered from the headboard in my eye"
photo-proofed kisses i remembered so well

trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
i sleep with your old shirts
and walk through this house in your shoes
you know, it's strange
it's a strange way of saying
that i know i'm supposed to love you
i'm supposed to love you
