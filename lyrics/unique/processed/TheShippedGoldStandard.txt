get get get get get out now!sometimes i want to quit this all and become an accountant now
but i'm no good at math and besides the dollar is down
plant palm trees on lake michigan before it gets cold
i gotta feel the wind chill again before i get old

i want to scream 'i love you' from the top of my lungs
but i'm afraid that someone else will hear me

you can only blame your problems on the world for so long
before it all becomes the same old song
as soon as we hit the hospital i know we're gonna leave this town
and get new passports and get get get get get out now

all the yes men said 'no comment'
my mouth got going the wrong way and all the calls started snowing
the time my dad caught me a horse shoe crab
and i asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back

i want to scream 'i love you' from the top of my lungs
but i'm afraid that someone else will hear me

you can only blame your problems on the world for so long
before it all becomes the same old song
as soon as we hit the hospital i know we're gonna leave this town
and get new passports, get out now

tell that boy i'll leave you alone now
like a stove, i'll turn my love down
supra and the prophet are both in the business of souls
