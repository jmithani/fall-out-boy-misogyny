coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile. i just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile. all of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine. cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind. you ought to keep me concealed just like i was a weapon. i didnt come for a fight but i will fight til the end. this one might be a battle, might not turn out okay. you know you look so seattle but you feel so la. and i love the way you hurt me. its irresistible, oh yeah. i love the way (yeah), i love the way (yeah). i love the way you hurt me, baby. i love the way (yeah), i love the way (yeah). i love the way you hurt me, baby. im gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble. frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble. like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation. truly free, love it, baby, im talking no inflation. too many war wounds and not enough wars. too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores. too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves. you know i give my love a f-f-four letter name. and i love the way you hurt me. its irresistible, oh yeah. i love the way (yeah), i love the way (yeah). i love the way you hurt me, baby. i love the way (yeah), i love the way (yeah). i love the way you hurt me, baby. youre second hand smoke, second hand smoke. i breathe you in but, honey, i dont know what youre doing to me. mon ch√©ri. but the truth catches up with us eventually. try to say live, live and let live. but im no good, good at lip service. except when theyre yours, mi amor. im coming for you and im making war. and i still love the way you hurt me. its irresistible, oh yeah. i love the way (yeah), i love the way (yeah). i love the way you hurt me, baby. i love the way (yeah), i love the way (yeah). i love the way you hurt me, baby
