do you have the time. to listen to me whine. about nothing and everything all at once?. i am one of those melodramatic fools. neurotic to the bone no doubt about it. sometimes i give myself the creeps. sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. it all keeps adding up. i think im cracking up. am i just paranoid. im just stoned. i went to a shrink to analyze my dreams. she said its lack of sex thats bringing me down. i went to a whore. he said my lifes a bore. so quit whining because its bringing her down. gasping to control. so i better hold on
