we're gonna shoot you
and there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
that could change just how this goes, no
we're gonna shoot you
we're gonna shoot you, whoa

when i said that i'd return to you
i meant more like a relapse
now and again, i think
"his and hers, for better or worse"
but the only ring i want buried with me
are the ones around my eyes
you're appealing to emotions that i simply do not have
i've got the red carpet blues, baby

so put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
but don't get the wrong idea
we're gonna shoot you
we're gonna shoot you
and there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
that could change just how this goes
and everyone shakes to the beat
with a barrel down their throat

put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
but don't get the wrong idea
we're gonna shoot you
we're gonna shoot you
and there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
that could change just how this goes
everyone shakes to the beat
with a barrel down their throat
but don't get the wrong idea
we're gonna shoot you
we're gonna shoot you

now press repeati speak fast and i'm not gonna repeat myself, no
so listen carefully to every word i say
i'm the only one who's gonna get away
with making excuses today
you're appealing to emotions that i simply do not have
blackmailed myself ('cause i ain't got)
'cause i ain't got anyone else
this is a stick up, give us all your inspiration
i've got the red carpet blues, baby
