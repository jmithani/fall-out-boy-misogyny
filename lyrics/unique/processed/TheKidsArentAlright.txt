stuck in the jet wash
a bad trip i couldn't get off
maybe i bit off more than i could chew
overhead of the aqua blue
fall to your knees bring on the rapture
blessed be the boys time can't capture
on film or between the sheets
i always fall from your window to the pitch black street
and with the black banners raised
as the crooked smiles fade
former heroes who quit too late
who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

and in the end
i'd do it all again
i think you're my best friend
don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
i'll be yours
when it rains it pours
stay thirsty like before
don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

i'm not passive but aggressive
take note, it's not impressive
empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
on my bedroom floor
we put your curse in reverse
and it's our time now if you want it to be
maul the world like the carnival bear set free
and your love is anemic and i can't believe
that you couldn't see it coming from me
and i still feel that rush in my veins
it twists my head just a bit to think
all those people in those old photographs i've seen are dead

and in the end
i'd do it all again
i think you're my best friend
don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
i'll be yours
when it rains it pours
stay thirsty like before
don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

sometimes i just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
and let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

and in the end
i'd do it all again
i think you're my best friend
don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
i'll be yours
when it rains it pours
stay thirsty like before
don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
