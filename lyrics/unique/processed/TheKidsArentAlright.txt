stuck in the jet wash. a bad trip i couldnt get off. maybe i bit off more than i could chew. overhead of the aqua blue. fall to your knees bring on the rapture. blessed be the boys time cant capture. on film or between the sheets. i always fall from your window to the pitch black street. and with the black banners raised. as the crooked smiles fade. former heroes who quit too late. who just wanna fill up the trophy case again. and in the end. id do it all again. i think youre my best friend. dont you know that the kids arent al-, kids arent alright. ill be yours. when it rains it pours. stay thirsty like before. dont you know that the kids arent al-, kids arent alright. im not passive but aggressive. take note, its not impressive. empty your sadness like youre dumping your purse. on my bedroom floor. we put your curse in reverse. and its our time now if you want it to be. maul the world like the carnival bear set free. and your love is anemic and i cant believe. that you couldnt see it coming from me. and i still feel that rush in my veins. it twists my head just a bit to think. all those people in those old photographs ive seen are dead. and in the end. id do it all again. i think youre my best friend. dont you know that the kids arent al-, kids arent alright. ill be yours. when it rains it pours. stay thirsty like before. dont you know that the kids arent al-, kids arent alright. sometimes i just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah. and let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon. and in the end. id do it all again. i think youre my best friend. dont you know that the kids arent al-, kids arent alright. ill be yours. when it rains it pours. stay thirsty like before. dont you know that the kids arent al-, kids arent alright
