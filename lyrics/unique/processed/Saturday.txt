i'm good to go
and i'm going nowhere fast
it could be worse
i could be taking you there with me
i'm good to go
but it looks like i'm still on my own
i'm good to go for something golden
though the motions i've been going through have failed
and i'm coasting on potential towards a wall
at a 100 miles an hour

when i say
two more weeks
my foot is in the door, yeah
i can't sleep
in the wake of saturday (saturday)
saturday
when these open doors were open-ended
saturday
when these open doors were open-ended

pete and i attacked the lost astoria
with promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence
and i read about the afterlife
but i never really lived more than an hour (more than an hour)

when i say
two more weeks
my foot is in the door, yeah
i can't sleep
in the wake of saturday (saturday)
saturday
when these open doors were open-ended
saturday
when these open doors were open-ended

and i read about the afterlife
but i never really lived
and i read about the afterlife

two more weeks
my foot is in the door
me and pete
in the wake of saturday
