last year's wishes are this year's apologies
every last time i come home
i take my last chance to burn a bridge or two
i only keep myself this sick in the head
'cause i know how the words get you (off)

we're the new face of failure
prettier and younger but not any better off
bulletproof loneliness at best, at best

me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you
me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you

collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep
out of the woods but i love
the tree i used to lay beneath, kissed teeth stained red
from a sour bottle baby girl with eyes the size of baby worlds

we're the new face of failure
prettier and younger but not any better off
bulletproof loneliness at best, at best

me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you
me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you
me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you
me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you

the best way to make it through
with hearts and wrists intact
is to realize two out of three ain't bad, ain't bad

me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you
me and you (honeymoon)
setting in a honeymoon
me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you, if i woke up next to you
me and you, setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you
honeymoon
