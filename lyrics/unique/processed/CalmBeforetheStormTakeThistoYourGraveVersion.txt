i sat outside my front window. this storys going somewhere. hes well hung and i am hanging up. theres a song on the radio that says:. lets get this party started.. so lets get this party started. what you do on your own times just fine. my imaginations much worse. i just never want to know. what meant the world had folded. like legs and fingers holding onto what escapes me;. what he has: a better kiss that never lasts. you said, between your smiles and regrets:. dont say its over.. dead and gone, dead and gone, yeah. the calm before the storm set it off. and the sun burnt out tonight. reception less than warm set it off. and the sun burnt out too. this is me standing in the arch of the door. hating that look thats on your face. that says theres another fool like me. theres one born every minute. theres one born every minute. what you do on your own times just fine. my imaginations much worse. i just never want to know. what meant the world imploded, inflated then demoted. all my oxygen to product gas. and suffocated my last chance to say.... between your smiles and regrets:. dont say its over.. dead and gone, dead and gone. the calm before the storm set it off. and the sun burnt out tonight. reception less than warm set it off. and the sun burnt out too. calm before the storm (set it off, set it off). calm before the storm set it off. and the sun burnt out tonight. reception less than warm set it off. and the sun burnt out tonight, yeah. sun burnt out tonight, the sun burnt out tonight
