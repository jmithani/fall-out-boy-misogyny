what you do on your own time's just fine
my imagination's much worse
i just never want to know

sun burnt out tonight, the sun burnt out tonighti sat outside my front window
this story's going somewhere
he's well hung and i am hanging up
there's a song on the radio that says:
"let's get this party started."
so let's get this party started

what you do on your own time's just fine
my imagination's much worse
i just never want to know
what meant the world had folded
like legs and fingers holding onto what escapes me;
what he has: a better kiss that never lasts

you said, between your smiles and regrets:
"don't say it's over."
dead and gone, dead and gone, yeah
the calm before the storm set it off
and the sun burnt out tonight
reception less than warm set it off
and the sun burnt out too

this is me standing in the arch of the door
hating that look that's on your face
that says there's another fool like me
there's one born every minute
there's one born every minute

what you do on your own time's just fine
my imagination's much worse
i just never want to know
what meant the world imploded, inflated then demoted
all my oxygen to product gas
and suffocated my last chance to say...
