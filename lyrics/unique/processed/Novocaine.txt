this is a black, black ski mask song. so put all of your anger on. in the truly gruesome do we trust. i will always land on you like a sucker punch. singing i am your worst, i am your worst nightmare. i am your worst, i am your worst nightmare. if you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you. you would never sing along. cast them out cause this is our culture. these new flocks are nothing but vultures. because they took our love and they filled it up. filled it up with novocaine and now im just numb. now im just numb. dont mind me, im just the son of a gun. so dont stop, dont stop till your heart goes numb. now im just numb. i dont feel a thing for you. im just a problem that doesnt want to be solved. so could you please hold your applause. take this sideshow and all its freaks. and turn it into the silver screen dream. singing i am your worst, i am your worst nightmare. i am your worst, i am your worst nightmare. if you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you. you would never sing along. cast them out cause this is our culture. these new flocks are nothing but vultures. because they took our love and they filled it up. filled it up with novocaine and now im just numb. now im just numb. dont mind me, im just the son of a gun. so dont stop, dont stop till your heart goes numb. now im just numb. i dont feel a thing for you. ooooh, i say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole. (hijack the hype, hijack the hype). i feel like a photo thats been overexposed. (hijack the hype, hijack the hype). because they took our love and they filled it up. filled it up with novocaine and now im just numb. now im just numb. dont mind me, im just the son of a gun. so dont stop, dont stop till your heart goes numb. now im just numb. i dont feel a thing for you
