we can’t stop time, although i wish we could
we can’t stop going, although i wish we would

time is a legacy and the clock is ticking way to fast
use it wisely or that bump in your heart will be your last

broken dreams so don’t stop, don’t be afraid to live
even the future shuts off our minds halfway through, but i feel it’s my time

a boy that wants to live it up won’t win the lottery so give it up
there’s a flame of the fire on the way to your brain
 childish pain
now we’re all grown up and it’s time to move on

the old days seem new
tomorrow comes too fast
but, when your life looks dim
live each day like it’s your last

i’d like to worry you with 
only sorrow is brought by the undone

broken dreams so don’t stop, don’t be afraid to live
even the filter shut from our minds halfway through, but i feel it’s my time
