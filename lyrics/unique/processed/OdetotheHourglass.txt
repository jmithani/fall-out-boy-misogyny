we cant stop time, although i wish we could. we cant stop going, although i wish we would. time is a legacy and the clock is ticking way to fast. use it wisely or that bump in your heart will be your last. broken dreams so dont stop, dont be afraid to live. even the future shuts off our minds halfway through, but i feel its my time. a boy that wants to live it up wont win the lottery so give it up. theres a flame of the fire on the way to your brain.  childish pain. now were all grown up and its time to move on. the old days seem new. tomorrow comes too fast. but, when your life looks dim. live each day like its your last. id like to worry you with . only sorrow is brought by the undone. broken dreams so dont stop, dont be afraid to live. even the filter shut from our minds halfway through, but i feel its my time
