When Rome's in ruins
We are the lions, free of the Colosseums
In poison places, we are anti venom
We're the beginning of the end

Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won

We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?

C'mon, make it easy, say I never mattered
Run it up the flag pole
We will teach you how to make boys next door
Out of assholes (hahaha!)
