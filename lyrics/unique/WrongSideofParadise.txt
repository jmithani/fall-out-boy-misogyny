You say "Please don't ever change"
But you don't like me the way
The way that I am
The way that I am

Champagne and problems toast
I'll never solve them, oh
I think I woke up on the wrong side of paradise
I'm trying to kick the habit
But when you're not around, I just can't stand it
Oh yeah, I think I woke up on the wrong side of paradise

(Ooh) The wrong side of paradise
(Ooh) The wrong side of paradise
(Ooh-ooh) I think I woke up on
(Ooh-ooh) The wrong side of paradise
(Ooh) The wrong side of paradise
(Ooh) The wrong side of paradise
(Ooh-ooh) I think I woke up on
The wrong side of paradise
