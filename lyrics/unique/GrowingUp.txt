I dried my eyes, now I'll crust them with sleep
I'll crust them over
She begged me, "Don't hate me"
She spun me a story
Where winning looks like losing
And I'm winning every time
So thread spools, sweetie, get ready
Until my silk is sold

Growing up
Growing up
Growing up

Yeah! I'll find myself anew
Yeah! I'll find myself anew

I've dried my eyes, now it's "Rushmore"
I'm deep with futures like Chicago
No, Glenview never meant a thing to me
She never meant a thing to me
Except for putting idealists in a body bag
Forget it
I'll go out tonight and piss on her doorstep
And listen to The Misfits "Where Eagles Dare"
To swallow whole

Up
Growing up
Growing up

Go!
Whoa, I guess I'm my own better half
Whoa, I guess I'm my own better half
Whoa, yeah, I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess I'm on my own
