Have you ever wanted to disappear?
And join a monastery
Go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane? (Passenger plane)

Permanent jet lag
Please take me back (Please take me back)
Please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in (Please let me in)
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam and
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor

It feels like fourteen carats but no clarity
When I look at the man who would be king
The man who would be king
Goes to the desert, the same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said
"We won, oh we won"
