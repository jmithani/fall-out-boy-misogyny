I wrote a goodbye note in lipstick on your arm
When you passed out
I couldn't bring myself to call
Except to call it quits

Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers and not the other way around
Racing through the city, windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa

This city says
Come hell or high water
Well, I'm feeling hot and wet
I can't commit to a thing
Be it heart or hospital

Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers and not the other way around
Racing through the city, windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa

The tombstones were waiting
They were half-engraved
They knew it was over
Just didn't know the date

And I cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
The same way I think of you
This is a love song in my own way
Happily ever after below the waist

Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers
Racing through the city, windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa

Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers and not the other way around
Ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as yo-ho-ho-oh
