Something make my chest stir
Something make my head blur
I'm not ready for a handshake with death, no
I'm just such a happy mess, whoa

The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more

I'm the invisible man
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me
So you can get, get addicted to this
You can get, get addicted to this, now

It's three drinks too late
To talk to anyone but myself
It's a three-and-two pitch
To walk to anywhere else, no

The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more

I'm the invisible man
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me
So you can get, get addicted to this
You can get, get addicted to this, now

I'm the invisible man
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror

I want to make you as lonely as me
So you can get, get addicted to this
You can get, get addicted to this, now

I'm the invisible man (I'm the invisible man)
I'm the invisible man (I'm the invisible)
I want to make you as lonely as me
'Cause I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man...
